Getting Started
---------------

Installing Snackbar is as easy as...

```bash
bower install snackbar
```
or maybe you wish to use NPM...

```bash
npm install node-snackbar
```
and if that doesn't float you, you can always download and implement the CSS and JS files...
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/snackbar.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="dist/snackbar.min.css" />
```

or via [CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/node-snackbar?path=dist)...
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-snackbar@latest/src/js/snackbar.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/node-snackbar@latest/dist/snackbar.min.css" />
```

Development
---------------

In order to contribute to the development of this library you will need [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)

```bash
npm install -g grunt
```

The files that are going to be edited are in the `src/` folder.
After making changes, you'll need to build the dist files by running

```bash
grunt build
```

The minified files will be in the `dist/` folder. Those files are the ones used
on the demo html, so simply reload the page and your changes should be visible.

Happy contributing!
